# Leetcode 75 Tests

## What is this?

This is a repo to store my solutions to the Leetcode 75 set of questions. In a lot of cases, they might not be the most
efficient solution, but I expect I'll revisit from time to time to look at efficiency improvements. They might also serve
as a useful reference for others to look at what has worked and what hasn't.


## Multiple Attempts
Where there are 2 or more methods, it is largely down to making multiple attempts to solve the problem, or creating an
inefficient attempt the first time round. Few of the solutions are in the top 90% of performant submissions and will likely
not achieve O1 time/space efficiency, they're practice.
